Library (take 2)
Still a work in progress until I update this readMe.  I have the js and html finally working correctly.  
Need to add some custom dispatch events to break up the coupling and then I can struggle with the CSS for a while.
****************
Moving on for now.  CSS still needs some beautifying, but everything works as intended.  For reference, this took forever.  My first roadblock.  Watched an entire wesbos course on JS so I could take a swing at this proper.
